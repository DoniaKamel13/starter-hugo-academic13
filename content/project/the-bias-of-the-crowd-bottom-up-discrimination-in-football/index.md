I﻿n this paper we investigate firstly the presence of bottom-up skin-tone based discrimination in football. Through an algorithm that detects skin tone and a unique dataset with players' valuations, from fans, we are able to study the presence of skin-tone based discrimination in football looking at the top 5 European leagues. Secondly, we aim to causally identify the effect of this discrimination on the players' valuation by the fans, which translate into their actual valuations and contracts made my the managers. We aim to do so my using a geographical RDD based on penalties missed by players, and how at the event of missing a penalty, players with darker skin-tone are punished much more severely than those with lighter skin-tones.
