Traditionally, economists have analysed the role of school grades, social networks, skills, neighbourhoods, and luck as the main determinants of educational and occupational choice (Becker et al., 2018; Chetty et al., 2022; Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Heckman and Mosso 2014; Fernández and Rogerson, 1997). In addition, there is a vast literature in economics showing that parental preferences are important in explaining children’s educational and occupational choices (Volland, 2013; Farre and Vella, 2013; Algan et al., 2022; Dohmen et al., 2012). In the specific context of migration, several studies in both sociology and economics have emphasised the importance of transmission of culture and norms of the home country of immigrants (Rocha et al., 2017; Alesina and Giuliano, 2015; Fernández and Fogli, 2009). However, there still remains a significant gap in the literature in regards to identifying the effect of culture and norms of home country on education and occupation choices of second-generation migrants. Our project aims to fill this gap by analysing how norms surrounding the relative status of different occupations in countries of origin influence the occupational choice of second-generation migrants in the destination country, in this case, Sweden.

The main objective of this research project is to analyse to what extent norms surrounding the relative status of different occupations in countries of origin determine the occupational choice of second-generation migrants. Our secondary research questions try to shed light on the characteristics and mechanisms of the effects. Firstly, to what extent do these differences persist as time, since arrival and reception of a residence permit, increases? Secondly, to what extent are these differences affected by the degree of integration of their parents? Thirdly, to what extent do these effects vary by income group, socio-economic status, gender, and high schools that the children attend? Fourthly, to what extent are these results magnified or diminished through residential sorting into ethnic enclaves? Fifthly, what is the relative importance of maternal or paternal countries of origin?
